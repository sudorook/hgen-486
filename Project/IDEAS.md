1. Classes of organisms within the population of a particular ages and sexes
   will grow that the same rate, meaning that the proportion of them within a
   population is stable (stationary).

2. From evolutionary theory, one could naively predict that populations will
   evolve to increase biotic potential by a) reducing mortality during
   reproductive age, b) increasing litter size, c) selecting against sterility,
   d) beginning reproduction earlier. This is constantly violated, which raises
   the question of what sort of selective or structural constraints push
   species toward particular demographic histories.

   - alpha: age of reproduction
   - omega: max age of reproduction
   - l_x: survivorship
   - lambda: maximum longevity
   - r: intrinsic rate of increase
   - c_x: stable age distribution of population
