# 1 Cancer cell population model

*Background: Last week in Problem 1.2, we used a deterministic model of
exponential growth for a cancer cell population.*

*Let's instead consider a model of a cancer cell population size, $N(t)$, as a
pure birth (Yule) process in which each cell gives birth at rate $r$ per hour.
That is, the general birth process where $\lambda_i = ri$ and $\mu_i = 0$ for
all $i$. Suppose the cancer population starts with ten cells and assume $r =
0.01$.*

*Answer the following questions:*

1. _Assuming $r = 0.01$, after how many hours should we expect an $e$-fold
   change in the mean value?_

2. _Assuming $r = 0.01$, use known exact solutions for $\mathbb{P}\big(N (t) =
   j\big)$ to plot the value of $\mathbb{P}\big(N (t) = j\big)$ for $1 \leq j
   \leq 100$ for four values of $t$ (in hours): $t \in \{0, 50, 100, 200\}$. Do
   this using a vertically stacked multi-panel plot. (Hint: If you use the
   negative binomial function in R be conscious of the parameterization!)_

3. _What is the mean and variance of the cancer cell population size after $200$
   hours?_

4. _**Extra Credit**. Revisit last weekâ€™s problem in which a proportion $m =
   0.0001$ of cancer cells enter the blood stream, and we asked at what time is
   there a $99%$ probability that the blood will have received $1000$ cancer
   cells.  Update your answer using our new stochastic model for the cancer
   cell source population size. (Continue to assume $r = 0.01$ and the starting
   population is size in the cancer is $10$ cells). Provide a value to the
   nearest tenth of an hour and assess if the number is higher or lower than in
   the deterministic model._


# 2 Basic molecular phylogenetics

*Background: Consider a three taxon tree of human, chimp, and gorilla. Assume
the human-chimp species divergence is $6$ million years ago. Assume the
human/chimp vs. gorilla divergence is $7$ million years ago. Assume a
substitution rate of $\mu = 0.2 * 10^{-8}$ per base pair (bp) per year. Further
assume the **Jukes-Cantor** model of DNA evolution and that the initial bp in
the common ancestor of all three species is equally likely to have been an $A$,
$C$, $T$, or $G$. The Jukes-Cantor model assumes that mutations of all types
are equally likely. (Note: Ignore the subtlety that sequence divergence times
often predate species divergence times).*

*Answer the following questions:*

1. _Write the rate matrix ($Q$) and the transition function ($P_{ij}(t)$) for
   the Jukes-Cantor model._

2. _Compute the log-likelihood of a site configuration where: human=$A$,
   chimp=$A$, gorilla=$G$ under the given phylogenetic tree. Show your
   calculations and/or code._

3. _Compute the log-likelihood for the same site configuration under a revised
   phylogeny where humans and gorillas now separate $6$ million years ago and
   chimpanzees separate from the human/gorilla common ancestor $7$ million
   years ago._

4. _Compare your results for 2 and 3 - which tree is favored and by how many
   log-likelihood units?  What is your judgment on whether there is enough
   support to favor one tree versus another. (Put another way, would you want
   to collect more data or can you already reach a confident decision on the
   phylogeny?)_

5. _Research the **Kimura two-parameter** and the **General Time Reversible**
   models of sequence evolution. Both of these models are more frequently used
   than the Jukes-Cantor model. Describe in one sentence what is useful about
   each model._
